integrit is in a near-perpetual feature freeze in order to avoid
creeping featurism.  The mailing lists are appropriate forums for
discussions of features.

Recommendations for patches:

  Patches for portability are welcome.  Please make patches against the
  latest version of integrit.  See the following page for information on
  how to use CVS to get it:
  
    http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=15369
  
  Patches should be context diffs or unified diffs.  Only substantive
  changes should be in the patches.  (e.g., reformatting the whitespace
  is not a substantive change and will make a patch unreadable.)
  
  There is no guarantee that submitted patches will be accepted.  Some
  of the patches that have been submitted so far have been directly
  applicable; some have contained helpful ideas; and some have contained
  changes that would have made integrit less portable, less general,
  less reliable, or less coherent.
