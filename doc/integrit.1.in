.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I integrit
system detects intrusion by detecting when trusted files have been altered.

By creating an integrit database (update mode) that is a snapshot of a
host system in a known state, the host's files can later be verified
as unaltered by running integrit in check mode to compare current
state to the recorded known state.  integrit can do a check and an
update simultaneously.
