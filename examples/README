This directory contains examples of how you can use integrit along
with other UN*X tools like perl, cron, etc.

integrit-run.c shows how to create a simple C program to run integrit
on multiple roots.  Most sites will use something like Bourne shell
scripts, but you can link integrit-run statically.  See the comments
at the beginning of integrit-run.c for more information.
