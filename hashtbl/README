			hashtbl version 2.00
			  -----------------

hashtbl is a standalone library adapted for use with integrit,
Copyright (c) 2001, 2002 Ed L Cashin.

You can make a test program, hash test, by issuing the command, "make
hashtest".  The hashtest runs slow because printing to the terminal is
slow, but also because it starts out with a very small capacity so as
to exercise the resizing parts of hashtbl.  You'd normally start with
a guesstimate of the capacity you'll really need.

Use libhashtbl in your programs by including "hashtbl.h", calling the
functions prototyped in hashtbl.h, and linking with "-lhashtbl".  The
library has to be in the places the compiler looks.  

You can run "make install" to make libhashtbl available on your
system.  You can also tell the compiler where to look with an option
(e.g., "-L/my/dir" for gcc.  See your compiler's docs).

I welcome feedback!
