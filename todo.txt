there's a test for the "long long" type in configure from a time when
I thought that I'd need it for cross-platform databases.  This test
isn't really needed, but I'm leaving it in, since it might come in
handy one day.

PROGNAME (with elcerror) doesn't work for utils programs

someone (but probably not me) might make the viewreport example viewer
for the XML output show the file characteristics that are included in
reporting a new file.

increased info for missing files has only been added to human-readable
output.  If someone is using XML misses it, it should be added to the
XML output as well.

keep an eye on the ranlib/ar stuff in the build process

more tests in the test suite.

put a filename identifier at top of all files to help when folks send
files to me.

provide a way for users to see debugging info?  user could see files
  that were being processed more easily than using lsof.

see if integrit can continue with warning when encountering a large
  file on a platform without support for large files.

satisfy autoconf 2.53 about the way config.h stuff is done.

change the way configure checks for stdint.h so that it works correctly,
e.g., on cygwin, which doesn't have stdint.h.

move dtd from xml.c into a documentation file.
